# FixMyTown

FixMyTown is a cross-platform mobile and web application designed to empower citizens to report, track, and resolve local civic issues efficiently. Users can submit reports about problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, waste management concerns, or water supply issues, attaching images, location data, and descriptions. Municipal authorities can review, prioritize, and update the status of reported issues in real-time, while citizens receive notifications about progress and resolution. By bridging the gap between the community and local authorities, FixMyTown promotes transparency, accountability, and faster resolution of urban problems, making towns smarter and more responsive to citizen needs.
